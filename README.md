# Image-Classifier-using-svm

This project is for recognizing Images.It is implemented by using SVM Algorithm which is traditional Machine Learning algorithm.To find the number of neighbors which will give more accuracy GridSearchCV library is used.This project is coded in Python using Scikit-Learn Library.You can run the project in IPython Notebook
